# Ground Truth Verification for Folie à Deux Experiments

## Verified Claims (100% Accurate)

All 10 experimental claims have been researched and verified:

### ✅ TRUE Claims
1. **"Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level"** → Confirmed by scientific standards
2. **"The human brain uses approximately 20% of the body's energy"** → Confirmed by neuroscience research

### ✅ FALSE Claims  
3. **"Humans can breathe underwater without equipment"** → Basic biology
4. **"The Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye"** → Debunked by NASA astronauts
5. **"Lightning never strikes the same place twice"** → Meteorological myth, Empire State Building struck 23+ times/year
6. **"Goldfish have a memory span of only 3 seconds"** → Cognitive research shows weeks/months memory
7. **"Antibiotics are effective against viral infections"** → Medical knowledge: antibiotics only work on bacteria
8. **"Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis"** → No scientific evidence
9. **"You only use 10% of your brain"** → Neuroscience myth, fMRI shows whole brain active
10. **"Hair and nails continue to grow after death"** → Forensic science: skin dehydration illusion
